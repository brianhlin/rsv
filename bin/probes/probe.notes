cacert-verify-probe - 
The probe is stateful.  If it notices that certificates are out of sync with the
distribution it is a warning, and it records the time.  If the problem persists
72 hours after it is first detected, it escalates to an error.

A successful check resets the timer (it deletes the state file)
