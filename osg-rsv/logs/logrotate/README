This directory contains all the files that are involved with daily rotation 
of the HTML pages located at $VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/output/html.

The script rotate_html_files.sh is called by condor-cron once a day.  If you
want to change the time that the logs are rotated at, edit the submission file
for this script at $VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/submissions/consumers/rotate_html_files.sub
This submission file will be regenerated everytime configure_osg_rsv is run with 
the --consumers flag passed (and when it is regenerated, the default will be 
restored).

The output in rotate_html_files.err is due to passing the verbose (-v) flag 
to logrotate, which then prints informative messages to STDERR.  The precense
of messages in this file is not a concern, however, if you see an actual
error message, something may be wrong.
