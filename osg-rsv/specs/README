Files in these sub-directories are of the form probe@metric.

How to use spec files
---------------------
The files in this directory are used to add extra arguments to the Arguments
line of the Condor submission files.  When possible, you should add options
via the configure_osg_rsv script options - see the documentation for
 configure_osg_rsv for a list of these.

Note:
 - The -m and --uri options will be added automatically by  configure_osg_rsv.
   You do not need to specify them here.  The URI argument can be changed by
   using the --uri argument to configure_osg_rsv.
 - The Cron time is separate from the Arguments, and it can be specified
   for each metric in $VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/config/metrics.conf.  This is only
   if you have a need to change the time that scripts run, defaults are
   provided.


Directory Structure
-------------------
The global-specs directory will be applied to all hosts.
The hostname directories will be applied only to that specific host.

The hostname spec *does not override* the global spec.  The arguments
are formed by concatenating the two files together.
